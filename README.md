# LearningBackEnd

## Overview

Welcome to my LearningBackEnd repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing all the backend projects I've built throughout my journey in backend development. Just like my LearningFrontEnd repository, where I showcase all my frontend projects, this repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my backend skills and projects.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to document and demonstrate my growth and learning in backend development. Each project within this repository represents a milestone in my journey, reflecting the skills and technologies I've acquired and implemented. This repository will continue to grow as I take on new challenges and build more backend applications.

## Technologies

Throughout my projects, I aim to explore and utilize a variety of backend technologies, including but not limited to:

-   **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
-   **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database.
-   **PostgreSQL**: Relational database.
-   **RESTful APIs**: Designing and implementing RESTful web services.
-   **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs.
-   **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing secure user authentication.
-   **Testing**: Using tools like Jest and Mocha for testing backend code.
-   **Deployment**: Deploying applications using platforms like Heroku, AWS, and Docker.

## Projects

This repository will contain a collection of projects, each focusing on different aspects of backend development. As I continue to learn and develop new projects, they will be added here. Each project will have its own folder and a detailed README file explaining the project's purpose, technologies used, setup instructions, and other relevant details.
