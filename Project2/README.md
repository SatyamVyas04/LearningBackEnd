# Project 2: Understanding Models

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing various data models. It contains some practiced models inside the `Models` folder. The setup is kept basic to emphasize the model structures and their relationships. The models include components for a Todo List application, namely the `User`, `Todo`, and `Sub_Todo`. Future additions will include models for an eCommerce website and hospital management system.
